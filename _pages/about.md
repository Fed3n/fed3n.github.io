I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, in the [Network and Cloud Systems](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/network-and-cloud-systems) group, advised by Prof. Yiting Xia.

My research interests lie in networked systems, with a strong focus on data center networks. As more computing power moves into data centers, I believe there is significant potential for improving efficiency and sustainability by pushing the current boundaries of network engineering. In particular, I am interested in designing specialized network stack solutions for alternative, cost-efficient data center architectures.

More specifically, my work so far has focused on routing and transport protocols for **reconfigurable data center networks**.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Saarland University. During this time, I worked as a HiWi (student assistant) in the same research group, where I first developed my first interest in reconfigurable data center networks.
Previously, I received by B.Sc. from University of Bologna advised by Prof. Renzo Davoli, working on userspace network virtualization and DNS in his [VirtualSquare](https://wiki.virtualsquare.org/) laboratory.
