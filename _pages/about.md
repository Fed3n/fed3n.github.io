I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Max Planck Institute for Informatics in the [Network and Cloud Systems](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/network-and-cloud-systems) group, advised by Prof. Yiting Xia.

My main research interests lie in Network and Operating Systems, with a strong focus on Data Center Networks. 
As computing power is moving to Data Centers, I believe there is much to be gained in terms of efficiency and sustainability by pushing the current boundaries of engineering. 
In that regard, I have been working on Optical Data Center Networks, which have the potential to efficiently serve large-scale infrastructures in the future.

I am passionate about building systems and making things work, I aim for my research projects to be built into working prototypes available for everybody to experiment with.
Such philosophy probably comes from my collaboration with Prof. Renzo Davoli in his [Virtualsquare](https://wiki.virtualsquare.org/) laboratory during my B.Sc. at University of Bologna, to whom I owe part of my passion for Operating Systems.
