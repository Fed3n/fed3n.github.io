I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Max Planck Institute for Informatics in the [Network and Cloud Systems](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/network-and-cloud-systems) group, advised by Prof. Yiting Xia.
My main research interests lie in Network Systems, with a strong focus on Data Center Networks. 
As computing power is moving to Data Centers, I believe there is much to be gained in terms of efficiency and sustainability by pushing the current boundaries of engineering. 
In that regard, I am interested in Optical/Reconfigurable Data Center Networks, which have the potential to efficiently serve large-scale infrastructures in the future.
More specifically, I am currently working on dedicated routing and transport for Reconfigurable Data Center Networks.

Before joining as a Ph.D. student, I was a M.Sc. student at Saarland University working as a HiWi (student worker) for the same research group, where I developed a strong interest for Reconfigurable Data Center Networks.
Previously, I received by B.Sc. from University of Bologna advised by Prof. Renzo Davoli, working on Userspace Network Virtualization and DNS in his [VirtualSquare](wiki.virtualsquare.org/) laboratory.
